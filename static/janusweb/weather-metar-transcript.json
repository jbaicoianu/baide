Note that you may have to use other services to look up, eg, closest weather station from GPS, use your discretion.\n\nStore the current METAR data in an object containing all the properties using standardized METAR names for properties like visibility, weather type, ceiling, winds aloft, time the reading was made, etc. This object will be returned asynchronously from our getWeather() function.",
