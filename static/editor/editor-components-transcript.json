    "content": "Ok, this code is getting a bit messy. I think we need to start refactoring it into custom elements instead of everything being oldschool top-level DOM manipulation.\n\nLet's break some of our key elements out into their own custom elements. Use the <baide-*> namespace for all of our elements. Looking at what we have, I think we should start with the following components:\n\n* <baide-editor> - the overall orchestrating element for the whole page\n* <baide-editor-code> - the code editor view with the CodeMirror textarea\n* <baide-project-tree> - the project tree on the left side of the page\n* <baide-project-selector> - project selector dropdown\n* <baide-branch-selector> - project tree's branch selector\n* <baide-file-tabs> - the tabbed list of open files\n* <baide-context-selector> - the dropdown for selecting coding conmtexts\n* <baide-chat> - the container which holds the chat history and the input for talking to our IDE\n* <baide-chat-history> - the chat history viewer\n* <baide-chat-input> - the chat input\n\nPlease refactor the existing code into these components. If any code doesn't fit cleanly into one of these elements, keep it as-is and let me know.\n\nMake sure that ALL logic related to these elements is implemented - I don't want a bunch of element stubs, I would like for these elements to fully encapsulate all the behavior that's currently specified in this file. At a minimum I should be able to select a project from <baide-project-selector>, which would populate <baide-project-tree>, and then selecting a file from the project tree should open a tab in <baide-file-tabs> and show the contents of the file in <baide-editor-code>. Our transcript should load into <baide-chat-history> and pressing ctrl+enter in our <baide-chat-input> element should submit the prompt to our /chat backend endpoint.\n\nAny CSS needed to support this should be put in a comment at the top of this file.",
