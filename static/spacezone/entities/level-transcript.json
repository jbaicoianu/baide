This HTML element is positioned in the top-left corner of the screen and dynamically updates whenever the budget changes. Additionally, two CSS classes, `budget_credit` and `budget_debit`, have been implemented to provide visual feedback for credit and debit transactions, respectively. These classes are temporarily applied and then removed after a short delay to trigger CSS transitions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Ensure that the CSS transitions align with the overall design of your application for a cohesive user experience.\n- Consider adding accessibility features to the HTML budget element for better usability.",
