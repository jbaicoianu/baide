This HTML element is positioned in the top-left corner of the screen and dynamically updates whenever the budget changes. Additionally, two CSS classes, `budget_credit` and `budget_debit`, have been implemented to provide visual feedback for credit and debit transactions, respectively. These classes are temporarily applied and then removed after a short delay to trigger CSS transitions.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- Ensure that the CSS transitions align with the overall design of your application for a cohesive user experience.\n- Consider adding accessibility features to the HTML budget element for better usability.",

Updating the budget should only update the contents of the span element, rather than rewriting the contents of the whole thing.\n- When a budget item is applied in our apply function, we should append a new html element to our budget display, which follows this format:\n\n<div class=\"budget_item\"><span class=\"budget_item_type\">${type}</span>: <span class=\"budget_item_value\">${value}\u20bf</span></div>\n\nAfter adding each budget_item, after 250ms we'll add the class name \"budget_item_removing\", then after 1500ms we'll remove the element from the dom and discard it.",
