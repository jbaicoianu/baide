Selecting an item from the grid will show the item's full details below, along with a buy button. When the buy button is clicked, we'll emit a \"purchased\" event, with the data attribute for our event containing the item we just bought.\n\nAll CSS needed for this should be placed in a comment at the top of this file.",
