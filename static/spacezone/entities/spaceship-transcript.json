    "content": "Let's add some scoring dynamics to the game. Create a spacezone-score element, and create one on our spaceship element. In startRace, we'll start off by calling this.score.reset().\n\nLet's also add a property to our new score element which contains scores for certain actions. For example:\n- time_elapsed: 100\n- weapon_fire: -5\n- race_complete: 10000\n\nLet's emit these events by adding this.dispatchEvent in the relevant places, and our score element can add event handlers which listen for the specified events and add the appropriate score value to our total score. For instance, our cannon element should dispatch \"weapon_fire\" events, and our spaceship should emit race_start (rename level_start) and race_complete events.",

Additionally, I've renamed the `level_start` event to `race_start` to better reflect its purpose. Please review the changes and let me know if you have any further adjustments or additions.",
