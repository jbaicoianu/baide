For example:\n- time_elapsed: 100\n- weapon_fire: -5\n- race_complete: 10000\n\nLet's emit these events by adding this.dispatchEvent in the relevant places, and our score element can add event handlers which listen for the specified events and add the appropriate score value to our total score. For instance, our cannon element should dispatch \"weapon_fire\" events, and our spaceship should emit race_start (rename level_start) and race_complete events.",
