<h1>Mission Failed</h1>
<p>Your ship shudders violently as the asteroid field tightens its grip. Alarms blare in your ears, the radiation levels spiking beyond safe limits. The hull groans under the stress, and you can feel the cold vacuum whispering at the edges of your consciousness. This is itâ€”the final moments before everything disintegrates into nothingness. The mission to deliver those medical supplies has failed. The colonists on Mars are counting on this delivery, and now, hope is slipping away into the darkness.</p>
<p>But as you brace for the end, a spark ignites within you. This isn't the end but a beginning. There's still a chance to fight back, to reroute, to survive. You lean into the chaos, determined to find a way to complete your mission. You won't let the colony fall. Not yet.</p>
