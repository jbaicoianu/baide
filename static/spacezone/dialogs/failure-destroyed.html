<h2>Mission Failed</h2>
<p>Your ship shudders violently as critical systems fail under severe damage. Alarms blare in your ears, the radiation levels spiking beyond safe limits. The hull groans under the stress, and you can feel the cold vacuum tugging at the edges of your consciousness. This is it â€” the final moments before everything disintegrates into nothingness. The mission to deliver the critical medical supplies has failed. The colonists on Mars were counting on this delivery, and now their hope is slipping away into the darkness.</p>
<p>Your vision goes dark, and you feel nothing. It's strangely peaceful. Suddenly you hear a beep, and a mechanical voice crackles to life. "Clone surrogate destroyed. Disengaging Neuralink interface." Another clone lost - that'll cost you. You curse under your breath, and get ready to fire up a new session. You're gonna have to pay off this debt somehow, and now it's even bigger. Oh yeah, and the Mars colonists still need your help too.</p>
