<h2>Mission Failed</h2>
<p>Your ship shudders violently as critical systems fail under severe damage. Alarms blare in your ears, the radiation levels spiking beyond safe limits. The hull groans under the stress, and you can feel the cold vacuum tugging at the edges of your consciousness. This is it â€” the final moments before everything disintegrates into nothingness. The mission to deliver the critical medical supplies has failed. The colonists on Mars were counting on this delivery, and now their hope is slipping away into the darkness.</p>
<p>But as you brace for the end, a spark ignites within you. This isn't the end but a beginning. There's still a chance to fight back, to reroute, to survive. You lean into the chaos, determined to find a way to complete your mission. You won't let the colony fall. Not yet.</p>
