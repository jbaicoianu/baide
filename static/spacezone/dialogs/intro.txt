<h2>Mission Briefing</h2>

<p>An alarm sounds, and a warning sign flashes up on your ship's dashboard. The red light blares against the dim interior, casting eerie shadows as you glance at the rapidly approaching asteroid field. The Van Allen belts' high radiation zone looms ahead, a treacherous path riddled with unpredictable dangers.</p>

<p>Your ship, the <em>Galactic Viberunner</em>, is delivering medical supplies to the beleaguered Mars Colony. These supplies are vital; The Mars colony's need is urgent, and every second spent in this radiation-soaked gauntlet reduces their efficacy.</p>

<p>Without warning, a series of explosions rock the vessel. Fragments of asteroid debris slam against the hull, sending alarms into overload. Your training kicks in; you maneuver deftly, swerving to avoid the incoming threats. Precision is key â€” one wrong move could mean the end of the mission, or worse, your life.</p>

<p>You grab the controls tightly and grit your teeth. It's gonna be a hell of a ride.</p>
