        <h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>
        <p>The tense journey through the asteroid field and high-radiation zones is finally over. You see a cargo ship waiting just outside the asteroid field, ready to take delivery of your precious cargo. Your radio crackles to life.</p>
        <p>"Thank god you made it! We've been counting on these medical supplies."  The relief in their voice is palpable. "It's gotten real bad down there. He's gone mad. I never would have accepted this assignment if I'd known how unhinged he'd become."
        <p>You don't really know what he's talking about - the Starlink communiqu√©s from the Mars base are light on details, and none of the usual threadbois on X have much to say about what's going on here. Ever since Musk left Earth, things have gotten weird. Or weirder. It's been weird for a while now.<p>
        <p>You try not to think too much about it. You're here to do a job, and there's more cargo waiting for you back home. You punch the tractor beam controls, and your cargo floats over to their ship, carried effortlessly by a brilliant energy beam. They thank you one more time, and blast off towards Mars.</p>
