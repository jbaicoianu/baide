# Spacezone Game Plot

## Overview

Set in the year **2036**, "Spacezone" unfolds on Mars, now an established colony housing tens of thousands of people. This rapid development was made possible by the accelerated timeline of SpaceX's original 2029 plan, driven by the world's richest man—modeled after Elon Musk—who leveraged his political connections and unprecedented control of people's perceptions and motivations via social media. Initially populated by scientists and engineers, Mars has seen a significant influx of inhabitants from all walks of life, thanks to these efforts. Despite his influential role, the richest man's identity remains unnamed in the game.

## Current Situation

A rebel faction within the colony has splintered off, igniting a civil war on Mars. Communication with Earth is severely limited as traditional media has been nearly eradicated due to recent political upheavals. News now flows primarily through biased and inaccurate reports from social media platforms like Twitter, spreading misinformation through various "threadbois."

## Protagonist's Mission

The player takes on the role of a protagonist tasked with an urgent mission: delivering highly sensitive medical supplies to the struggling Mars colony. This perilous journey involves navigating through an asteroid field in the Van Allen belt, exposing the ship to high levels of radiation. The medical supplies are time-sensitive and decay rapidly when exposed to radiation.

### Ship Specifications

- **Radiation Shield Generator:** Protects the cargo during the trip.
- **Containment Field:** Any physical damage to the ship reduces the effectiveness of the containment field, accelerating the decay of medical supplies.

## Gameplay Objectives

- Start with a fixed number of medical supplies.
- Navigate through a space-based obstacle course aiming to reach the other side with the maximum number of viable supplies intact.
- Encounter various dangers along the way, including:
  - Asteroids
  - Space mines
  - Turrets
  - Movable energy barriers set by the splinter colonists

## Story Progression

As players make deliveries, they gather information from interactions with various characters. Initially, reports from Earth depict the richest man on Mars as a benevolent benefactor dedicated to saving humanity. However, as the journey progresses, it becomes evident that he is the leader of the splinter colony, driven by a paranoid fear of the "woke mind virus." This fear leads him to believe that the scientists and engineers are undermining his efforts with their philosophies of acceptance and inclusiveness.

### Conflict Details

- **Richest Man:** Leader of the rebel faction, paranoid and authoritarian.
- **Scientists and Engineers:** Focused on maintaining daily operations and the well-being of the colony, confused by the backlash against their work.

## Player's Choice and Conclusion

Players must decide which side to support by determining whom to assist with their deliveries. A running leaderboard tracks player contributions to each faction, influencing the game's outcome based on collective player decisions.
