    "content": "I have updated the `static/spacezone/entities.js` file as per your instructions. The `maxspeedmultiplier` has been reverted to `2` in the `spacezone-player` element. Additionally, the `spacezone-cannon` element now dynamically sets its `muzzlespeed` each frame based on the `currentSpeedMultiplier`.\n\nPlease review the changes to ensure the parent references for `currentSpeedMultiplier` are correct based on your project's hierarchy.",
