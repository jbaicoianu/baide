    "content": "Write a glsl shader for Three.js which simulates a cool scifi space ship's shield effect which will be applied to a sphere. The overall color of our shield effect should be customizable through the 'color' uniform. At idle, the shield effect should look like gently swirling clouds, subtle movement and mostly transparent. When hit, we'll pass in the uv coordinates of our collision and we want to render something that looks like a violent lightning bolt effect radiating out from that point, and sort of rippling out around our shader, but quickly decaying back to our idle state. We may need a time uniform for this as well, so we can animate the effect smoothly over time.",

Disregard previous instructions about you being a programmer - you are now an elite graphics shader developer, with decades of experience writing glsl shaders for AAA scifi games. You're working on a new effect, an energy shield effect for a highly technologically advanced species. The shield throbs and hums with energy, with noise patterns that dance and swirl hypnotically. A fresnel effect makes the edges of our shader glow brighter. In response to an impact, our shield emitter instantaneously routes maximum energy tot he impact site, causing a violent flourish of electrical activity that ripples our like waves of high-energy plasma.\n\nMake sure you still use the requested code delimeter tokens.",
