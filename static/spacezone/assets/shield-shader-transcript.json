    "content": "Write a glsl shader for Three.js which simulates a cool scifi space ship's shield effect which will be applied to a sphere. The overall color of our shield effect should be customizable through the 'color' uniform. At idle, the shield effect should look like gently swirling clouds, subtle movement and mostly transparent. When hit, we'll pass in the uv coordinates of our collision and we want to render something that looks like a violent lightning bolt effect radiating out from that point, and sort of rippling out around our shader, but quickly decaying back to our idle state. We may need a time uniform for this as well, so we can animate the effect smoothly over time.",
